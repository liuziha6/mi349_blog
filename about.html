    <h2>my introduce</h2>
    <p>Hi, everyone. My name is <strong>Zihao Liu</strong>, and I come from <strong>China</strong>. My friends usually call me <strong>Z</strong> because my Chinese name is hard to pronounce. Up to 2021, it is the <em>3rd year </em>for me to study in the US.</p>
    <p>At the very beginning, I was a CSE student in MSU. However, I overestimated my ability and found that is such difficult. Then, I have no choice but to change my major in MI. I found this major is terrific without sitting there and writing deadly coding. Hope this website could make more people know me better.  </p>

    <h2>my personalities</h2>

            <li><strong>Sensitive</strong></li>
